Title: Monte Carlo Simulation Tools Using a Functional Approach
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Imad EL BADISY

Description: The mcstatsim package offers an efficient, functional programming-based 
    approach for statistical simulations, centralizing the process in a single higher-order 
    function for better manageability. Besides, it includes ready-to-use functions for well-known 
    simulation targets. The core `runsim()` function processes simulation 
    parameters via expanded grid, mapping them to the simulation function. 
    Replication management is performed through the `replicater()` function, which estimates 
    the remaining time (ETA) with an option to hide progress via `show_progress = FALSE`. 
    Outputs are deliberately structured as dataframe to simplify analysis and visualization, 
    addressing the limitations of list outputs in data manipulation.
