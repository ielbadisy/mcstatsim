Description: 
    The `mcstatsim` package is a lightweight, dependency-free tool designed to facilitate statistical 
    simulations through functional programming. It centralizes the simulation process into a single 
    higher-order function, enhancing manageability and usability without adding overhead from external 
    dependencies. The package includes ready-to-use functions for common simulation targets and processes 
    simulation parameters via lists or expanded grids, all while utilizing parallel processing on multicore 
    mode to improve efficiency on macOS and Linux-based distributions.
